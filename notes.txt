Notes to myself you're welcome to view and hopefully answer

I have the choice between using XML attributes or using code on a lot of options like a onClick attribute VS a onClickListener
But with code I can change my values latter like with background color

In GameActivity using someAnim = ObjectAnimator.ofFloat(nullObject, ...) while settting nullObject to point to an actual
object gave me a null pointer exception. Does someAnim create a copy of nullObject and not keep the reference?

Bitmap must be scaled down when placing in a view due to openGL limits (2048 max).

Also Bitmaps must be scaled down when placing into a bitmap since space is limited.
Bitmap.createScaledBitmap() helps
