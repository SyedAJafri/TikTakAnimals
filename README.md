TicTacAnimals
=============
Instead of Xs and Os why not use your face or some cute furry animals. 

Warning
-------
This game was not created for anyone to actually use. It's actually pretty horrible as a game.
This is the first app I created and was mostly meant to test myself after reading/watching a large amount of android tutorials/guides.
I started by using what I learned over time without using any kind of guide, besides the android developer reference.
I will be adding more over time as I learn additional Android and Java concepts.

Update 2: Added more features and fixes like having the game end in animations, and using the camera/gallary instead of animals.

Apologies
---------
I am sorry if I am breaking any good design/coding practices. Some of them might be made out of impatience (hardcoding strings vs referencing them) or 
not knowing. I'm still new to coding, and I might do some out of impatience just becuase I don't have any future plans for this app.

Sounds
------
Sounds in this file were created by me in FM8 and Ableton. Please give me credit if you want to use them.
